Introduction
-----------------------------
Every once in a while, one might feel stressed and hate what they are doing. During these challenging periods,
they have low energy and are not sure what to do, and it takes time to adjust to get through it.
Some don't even realize it because they have no goal so there is no incentive to change.

Things will start to change by doing some small positive things everyday,
even if it is so tiny that requires no effort, don't stop it,

like doing 1 push up a day,
To be there might be more important than the task itself
