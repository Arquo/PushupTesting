Introduction
-----------------------------
Every once a while, one might feel stressed and hate what they are doing. During these challenging period,
they have low energy and not sure what to do, and it takes time to adjust to get through it.
Some don't even realize it because they have no goal so there is no incentive to change.

Things will start to change by doing some small positive thing everyday,
even it is so tiny that require no effort, dont stop it,

like doing 1 push up a day,
To be there might be more important than the task itself
And you will notice your change
